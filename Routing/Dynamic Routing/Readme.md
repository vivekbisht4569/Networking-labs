# 📌 Definition

Dynamic routing is a method where routers automatically exchange routing information using routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP. Routes are learned and updated dynamically without manual configuration of each route.

# ⚙ How It Works

1. Routers run a routing protocol.

2. They exchange routing information with neighboring routers.

3. They automatically build and maintain routing tables.

4. If the network topology changes, routes are updated automatically.

# 📍 Where Dynamic Routing Is Used

. Dynamic routing is commonly used in:
. Medium to large enterprise networks
. ISP networks
. Networks with frequent topology changes
.Redundant and multi-path networks
