# Routing Labs

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains practical routing configuration labs performed using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The focus of these labs is to understand how routers forward packets between different networks and how routing tables determine packet paths.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand Layer 3 communication
- Configure router interfaces manually
- Implement Static Routing
- Test connectivity between different LAN networks
- Troubleshoot routing issues

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Default Gateway
- Routing Table
- Next-Hop Address
- Static Route Configuration
- Directly Connected Networks
- End-to-End Connectivity Testing

---

## 🧪 Labs Included

### 1️⃣ Static Routing Lab
- Manual IP configuration on PCs and routers
- Router-to-router connection
- Static route using CLI
- Router-to-router ping verification
- PC-to-PC connectivity testing

---

## 🔧 Skills Practiced

- CLI configuration on Cisco routers
- Using `ip route` command
- Interface configuration (`ip address`, `no shutdown`)
- Verifying routes using:
  - `show ip route`
  - `show ip interface brief`
  - `ping`

---

## 📡 Why Routing is Important

Routing allows communication between different networks. Without routing, devices can only communicate within the same subnet.

Understanding routing is fundamental for:
- Network administration
- Enterprise network design
- Troubleshooting real-world networks

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

After completing these labs, I am able to:

- Configure static routing between multiple networks
- Analyze routing tables
- Identify default gateway issues
- Troubleshoot Layer 3 communication failures
